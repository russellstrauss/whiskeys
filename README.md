## Getting Started

Follow instructions below for local webserver set up.

https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally

### Prerequisites

Node.js

### Installing

If you have Node.js installed on your machine, you can run the following commands in the root of this directory:

```
npm install
gulp
```

If it is your first time running gulp, you will need to run the following command only the first time:

```
npm install gulp -g
```

After running the gulp command, a new browser window will open with the project running.

### Running

After completing the above steps (you must re-run the 'npm install' command if the node_modules folder has been deleted), you can run the application by simply running the command 'gulp' in the root of the directory.

```
gulp
```
